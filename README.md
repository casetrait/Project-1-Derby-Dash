## Inspiration
---

This is a game I played at family gatherings at my gradnparents house growing up. We played with nickles; I cheered on my horses in hopes to win enough to buy a treat from the convenience store when it was all over. I wanted to re-create the fun my family and I would experince playing the game in an easy-to-use click-to-play browser game.

## Technology
---
I utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the game as true to the rules and layout as possible with a more modern casino themed appearance in the browser than on the classic wooden game board.

Using the popular architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC), the code is easy to navigate and the gameplay and render process is smooth in the browser. The message bar at the top of the game guides the user through the steps of the gameplay with ease and no previous required knowledge of the game.
